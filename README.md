# GameMoveDatasetCollector
This script helps in taking screenshots and recording corresponding keypresses. Hence creating datasets for games. One can even use the resultant datasets for training machine learning and deep learning models.


The steps to use the script are simple and as follows:
1) Open the game window.
2) Run the script with changes in window_name, x, y, width and height variables.
3) Play the game(to let the script capture screenshots and record keypresses).
4) Press 'esc' to stop script and get folder with screenshot images and csv file that maps the screenshots to corresponding keypresses.
5) Use images as you wish.
